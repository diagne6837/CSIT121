           <h2>Lab Summary</h2>
           <p>This is my first lab assignment coding a blog page that includes 
            reflection of what I have learned so far. The practice assignment
            that we did throughout the module help break down this assignment
            easily.</p>

            <h2>Lab3 Reflection</h2>
            <p>In this module, I learned to link a css file to an HTML document.
                Before starting with this assignment, I went back to the Lab02 feedback,
                and fixed my errors. I also added basic CSS properties, such as background colors,
                font styling and link styling to the HTML document. I still don't completely understand
                the difference between class and ID selectors. I've watched videos from the W3 schools website,
                and it helped a lot with understanding the fundamental of CSS. I used the notes from our learning 
                module and the notes from the W3 schools website to help with this assignment. I plan on practicing
                more with the basic CSS properties as well as HTML, so I won't have to rely on notes.
