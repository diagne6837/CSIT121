            <h2>My Final Project Reflection</h2>
            <p>
                Creating this final project helped me realize just how much I ve learned since the beginning of the semester.
                At first, I didn t really understand how websites were built, but Lab 01 and Lab 02 introduced me to basic HTML structure
                and gave me a good starting point. When we got into Lab 03 with CSS, I really struggled with styling especially getting colors, fonts, and spacing to work together.
                It was frustrating at times, but slowly I started to understand how CSS affects the entire look and feel of a page.
            </p>
            <p>
                Labs like the Visual Media Lab (Lab 04) and Layout Lab (Lab 05) really helped me improve the design and layout of my pages.
                Lab 06 made me think more critically about UI/UX, and I started to see web design differently. Lab 08 was also a challenge, 
                especially getting the interactive menu to behave how I wanted, but it was rewarding once it worked. Unfortunately, I didn't complete
                Lab 09 properly, which was about XML. I struggled to connect it with the rest of my project and didn t manage my time well enough that week.
                That was a learning moment too.
            </p>

                I tested my final website on Edge, and my phone. It looked slightly different on each, which taught me that browsers can interpret CSS 
                in slightly different ways. I also learned how important media queries are; I never thought about mobile layouts until this class. Overall, I feel like I ve built a solid foundation
                in web development. This class taught me not only how to build a website, but also how to think like a designer and problem-solver.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, I learned a lot in CSIT 121 and I'm glad we put everything together in this project. I know there is still more 
                to learn, but this gave me a solid foundation to keep practicing web development.
