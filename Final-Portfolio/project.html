            <h2>How This Project Came Together</h2>
            <p>
                This site was created as the final project for CSIT 121: Introduction to Web Development.
                The goal was to design a portfolio-style website that showcases the labs and skills we learned throughout the semester.
            </p>
            <p>
                The project includes four HTML pages, each styled with CSS. I used structural elements (header, main, aside, footer, etc) for layout,
                along with external stylesheets for consistent design. Media queries were added to improve the user experience on mobile devices.
            </p> 
            
            <h3>What is on the Site</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Home:</strong>A quick intro with an image and summary on the site.</li>
                <li><strong>Project:</strong>An explanation of how the page was made.</li>
                <li><strong>Labs:</strong>Links to the completed labs throughout the course.</li>
                <li><strong>Reflection:</strong>A summary of my thoughts and what I learned in this class.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Creating this site helped me practice organizing content, linking pages properly, and keeping everything accessible and responsive.
               It was a great way to bring all the semester's work together.
