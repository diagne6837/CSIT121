           <h2>Lab02 Reflection</h2>
           <p>This is my first lab assignment coding a blog page that includes 
            reflection of what I have learned so far. The practice assignment
            that we did throughout the module help break down this assignment
            easily.</p>

                <h2>Lab03 Reflection</h2>
                <p>In this module, I learned to link a css file to an HTML document.
                Before starting with this assignment, I went back to the Lab02 feedback,
                and fixed my errors. I also added basic CSS properties, such as background colors,
                font styling and link styling to the HTML document. I still don't completely understand
                the difference between class and ID selectors. I've watched videos from the W3 schools website,
                and it helped a lot with understanding the fundamental of CSS. I used the notes from our learning 
                module and the notes from the W3 schools website to help with this assignment. I plan on practicing
                more with the basic CSS properties as well as HTML, so I won't have to rely on notes.

            <h3>Lab05 Reflection</h3>
            <p> For this assignment, the focus was making my blog page responsive using CSS flexbox. I structured
                the layout so that on mobile devices, all blog posts appear in a single column format and on desk
                top screens, the page to a two column layout using media queries.it helps create a better user
                experience by adapting to different screen sizes. I was testing the page as I was going so I wouldn't 
                accumulate too many syntax errors at the end. Overall, this assignment is very complicated and very 
                technical but it gave me a better understanding of CSS grid and responsive design.
