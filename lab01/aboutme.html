                I am learning to code with Python by watching Youtube videos and reading books. in addition, 
                I learned sewing in elementary school and now use those skills to make wigs for my hair extension
                business. 
                I have a few hobbies that keep me busy. I like staying active with Pilates and yoga and
                I enjoy taking African dance classes as well, which connect movement and culture. I love reading books on personal growth,
                fiction, and IT related topics. In addition,  I appreciate art, history, and culture through museum visits.
