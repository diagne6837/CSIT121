            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am an African woman who has been living in the US for 10 years. I'm pursuing a career in IT because 
                I have always been curious and wanted to understand the behind the scenes of a computer. I am very indecisive when it comes to the career 
                path I want to pursue.

            <h2>Skills/Hobbies</h2>
            <p>

                I am learning to code with Python by watching Youtube videos and reading books. In addition, 
                I learned sewing in elementary school and now use those skills to make wigs for my hair extension
                business. 
                I have a few hobbies that keep me busy. I like staying active with Pilates and yoga and
                I enjoy taking African dance classes as well, which connect movement and culture. I love reading books on personal growth,
                fiction, and IT related topics. In addition,  I appreciate art, history, and culture through museum visits.
