        <h2>The Hungry Man</h2>
        <img src="lab04/images/hungry1.gif" alt="an animated GIF">
        <P> This is a funny animated GIF file. I chose this file to describe how I was feeling at the moment.
            I was very hungry and didn't eat all day due to fasting. My stomach was making noises and this GIF described 
            very well how I was feeling.
        </P>

        <h2>Image of one of my Favorite Shows</h2>
        <img src="lab04/images/greys anatomy.webp" alt="webp file example">
        <p>Grey's Anatomy happens to be one of my favorite show and thats why I chose this image.
            I can binge watch it for hours and never get tired of watching it because it's not predictable.
            I first watched it in 2009 and fell in love with it. I used to watch it with my grandfather, that's 
            why it means so much to me.

        <h2>Ramadan</h2>
        <img src="lab04/images/ramadan.jpg" alt="jpg file example">
        <p> I chose this image because we started our fasting March 1st, which marks the first day of
            Ramadan. Ramadan is very important to us because it's a sacred month of fasting, prayer, self-reflection,
            and devotion to God. We eat dates during Ramadan, especially to break our fast. This image describes thats
            perfectly.
