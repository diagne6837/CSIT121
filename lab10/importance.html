                <p>
                    WebAuthn is a new standard that helps websites and apps offer the same type of secure login across different browsers and devices.
                    Before this, there wasn't really one clear way for people to sign in safely online. Now that WebAuthn is approved, it makes things more easier
                    for both developers and users by giving everyone a consistent and trusted way to login.              
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest reasons WebAuthn is important is because it's way more secure than regular passwords. Instead of typing something in something
                    hackers can steal, WebAuthn uses keys that are kept safe on your device. More people rely on digital tools; protecting accounts is becoming more important 
                    than ever. This really means there is less risk of getting hacked or tricked by fake 
                    websites, which happens a lot with passwords.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It also makes logging in faster and easier. You can use your fingerprint, face ID, or even a security key instead of remembering
                    a bunch of passwords or waiting for a text code or email verification. What if you changed your phone number or no longer use that email?
                    It gives users more options and lets them choose  what works best for them. Overall, WebAuthn is a big upgrade in both security and convenience.
