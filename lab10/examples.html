                <p>
                    WebAuthn is already being used by some of the biggest tech companies out there. Google, Microsoft, Apple, most social media platforms
                    all support login using biometrics like fingerprints or face scans, and even security keys. This means users don't have to type in a 
                    password at all. They can just tap a button or scan their finger to sign in. It's way more convenient and a lot safer than traditional 
                    logins.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Developers use WebAuthn by working with JavaScript. The main function they use is navigator.credentials.create(), which helps the browser
                    talk to the device's built-in security tools. It's a way to safely connect the website to things like fingerprints, scanners or face ID.

                <p>
                    Some sites use WebAuthn by itself, and others use it along with a password for extra security. Either way, it makes logging in faster and more secure.
                    As more websites start using it, we will probably see fewer passwords and more easy, secure ways to sign in.
