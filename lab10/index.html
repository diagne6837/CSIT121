            <h2>Introduction to WebAuthn</h2>
            <p>
                Authenticators are devices that can generate private/public key pairs and gather consent. WebAuthn is an API that allows websites to communicate 
                with a security device to let a user log into their service. It's a modern way to login to websites using fingerprint, face scan, or a USB security key. The WebAuthn standard opens the door to a new, 
                streamlined, and more secure user experience, in which securely logging into websites, services, and apps takes just seconds from any device.  
            </p>
            <p>
                WebAuthn is part of a group of standards called FIDO2. Most big web browsers are starting to use this tool. It makes logging in easier and helps stop phishing
                scams. WebAuthn extends the Credential Management API and adds a new credential type called PublicKeyCredential. WebAuthn abstracts the communication between the browser and an authenticator and allows a user to 
                create and register a public key credential for a website and authenticate to a website by proving possession of the corresponding private key. 
            </p>
            <p> 
                Websites and apps can use this feature to let people log in more easily using things like fingerprint, phones, or security keys;
                and it's much safer than just using a password. These standards were created to make the internet safer and easier to use by cutting out passwords,
                which are often reused and easily hacked. WebAuthn works with two classes of authenticators: internal and external.
